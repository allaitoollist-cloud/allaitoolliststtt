## 🏗️ Core Article Architecture

### 1. The Executive Summary (Workflow Efficiency)
*   **Goal:** Identify the fastest tool for creators.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Best for Podcasters:** [Tool Name] (e.g., Descript / Riverside).
    *   **Best for Social Clips (Shorts/TikTok):** [Tool Name] (e.g., Opus Clip / Munch).
    *   **Best for Premiere Pro Users:** [Tool Name] (e.g., FireCut / AutoPod plugins).
    *   **Quick Stat:** Average time saved per 1-hour footage.

### 2. Technical Primer: "Text-Based Editing" & NLP
*   **Goal:** Explain the paradigm shift.
*   **Content:**
    *   Define **Transcription-Based Editing**: "Edit video by deleting text."
    *   Explain **Speaker Diarization**: How AI distinguishes Speaker A vs Speaker B.
    *   Define **Silence Removal Algorithms**: How threshold (dB) and padding (ms) settings work.

### 3. Evaluation Criteria (The "Editor's Benchmark")
*   **Goal:** Test for real-world production pain points.
*   **Criteria to Rate:**
    1.  **Transcription Accuracy (WER - Word Error Rate):** We tested with accents and background noise.
    2.  **"Magic Cut" Precision:** Does silence removal cut off the breath or the start of a word?
    3.  **Auto-Caption Styles:** Are the templates trendy (Alex Hormozi style) or generic?
    4.  **Export Speed:** Rendering time for 1080p vs 4K.

### 4. Deep-Dive Tool Reviews (Top 6 Tools)
*Focus: Descript, Opus Clip, Premiere Pro (AI Features), Gling, Wisecut, Munch*

**[Tool Name]**
*   **The "One-Liner":** The specific workflow it solves (e.g., "The Repurposing Engine").
*   **Technical Specifications:**
    *   *Supported Formats:* .mp4, .mov, multi-track audio?
    *   *Cloud vs Local:* Does it upload footage or process on-device?
    *   *Max File Size:* e.g., 5GB upload limit.
*   **The "Workflow Test":**
    *   **Input:** A 30-minute unedited podcast raw file.
    *   **Task:** Clean silence, remove "umms", add captions, export 3 viral clips.
    *   **Result:** How many clicks? How many minutes took?
*   **Pros & Cons:**
    *   *Pro:* "One-click 'Studio Sound' completely removes echo."
    *   *Con:* "Web editor lags with 4K files."

### 5. Comparative Analysis (The Efficiency Audit)

### 6. Guide: The "AI-Assisted" Editing Workflow
*   **Goal:** Teach the user how to integrate these tools.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  Ingest & Transcribe (Tool A).
    2.  Rough Cut (Text-Based).
    3.  Fine Tune (Timeline).
    4.  Export to NLE (XML Export logic).
