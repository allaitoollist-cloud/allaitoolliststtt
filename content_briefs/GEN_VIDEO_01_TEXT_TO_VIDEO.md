## 🏗️ Core Article Architecture

### 1. The Executive Summary (The "Answer First" approach)
*   **Goal:** Answer the user's intent immediately.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Best Overall:** [Tool Name] (e.g., Runway Gen-2) - Briefly allow *why* (cite one specific spec like "temporal consistency").
    *   **Best for Photorealism:** [Tool Name] (e.g., Sora / Hailuo).
    *   **Best for Animation/Anime:** [Tool Name] (e.g., Pika Labs).
    *   **Quick Spec Table:** Columns for Resolution, Max Duration, Pricing Model, API Access.

### 2. Scientific Definition: How Text-to-Video Models Work
*   **Goal:** Establish authority. Define the technology before reviewing it.
*   **Content:**
    *   Briefly explain **Diffusion Models** and **Temporal Consistency** (the challenge of keeping a character looking the same across frames).
    *   Define **FPS (Frames Per Second)** and **Generation Speed** in the context of AI.
    *   *Constraint:* No generic "AI is magic" talk. Use technical terms.

### 3. Evaluation Criteria (The "Review Framework")
*   **Goal:** Show the reader *how* we tested.
*   **Criteria to Rate:**
    1.  **Prompt Adherence:** Does the video actually show what the text asked for?
    2.  **Temporal Stability:** Is there flickering or morphing?
    3.  **Resolution & Ratio:** Can it do 1080p? 16:9? Vertical 9:16?
    4.  **Generation Cost:** Cost per second of video generated.

### 4. Deep-Dive Tool Reviews (Top 5-7 Tools)
*For each tool (Runway, Pika, Stable Video Diffusion, Kaiber, HeyGen, etc.), follow this strict format:*

**[Tool Name]**
*   **The "One-Liner":** A single sentence defining its primary strength.
*   **Technical Specifications:**
    *   *Max Resolution:* e.g., 2K
    *   *Max Duration:* e.g., 4s (extendable to 16s)
    *   *Pricing:* e.g., $15/mo for 625 credits
*   **The Stress Test (Crucial):**
    *   Describe a specific complex prompt you tested (e.g., "A drone shot of a cyberpunk city in rain").
    *   Analyze the result: Did it handle the rain reflection? Was the drone movement smooth?
*   **Pros & Cons:** Bullet points. Be harsh on Cons (e.g., "Faces distort at distance").

### 5. Comparative Analysis (The Data Section)
*   **Goal:** Direct comparison for decision makers.
*   **Format:**
    *   **Speed Test:** Chart showing generation time for a 4s cip across all tools.
    *   **Cost Analysis:** Calculate the exact "Cost per Second" of video for each tool's Pro plan.

### 6. Guide: Optimizing Prompts for Video
*   **Goal:** Add utility value.
*   **Content:** Explain "Camera Control" syntax (e.g., `-motion 2`, `-camera_zoom 1.5` for Midjourney/Runway-style parameters).

## 🚫 "Zero Fluff" Policy Guidelines
*   **BANNED WORDS:** "Game-changer", "Revolutionary", "Next level", "In today's digital world", "Cutting-edge".
*   **REQUIRED:** Use specific numbers. Instead of "It generates video fast," write "It generates 4 seconds of video in ~45 seconds on an A100 GPU."
*   **SOURCING:** Link to the official documentation or pricing page for every claim about specs.

## 🖼️ Visual Engineering Requirements
1.  **Header Image:** Custom branded graphic comparing a frame from Tool A vs Tool B.
2.  **The "Prompt vs Result" Strip:** For every tool review, include a screenshot showing:
    *   Left: The exact text prompt used.
    *   Right: A high-res frame of the result.
    *   *Note:* Ensure the tool's UI/Interface is visible if relevant (e.g., showing the settings panel).
3.  **Data Charts:** Use a simple bar chart for the "Cost per Second" comparison.
